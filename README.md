# QA Portfolio

This repository contains curated QA artifacts demonstrating my approach to software quality assurance, test design, and defect documentation.

It complements my application repositories by collecting **test plans, manual test cases, bug reports, and exploratory testing notes** in one place, with a focus on clarity, traceability, and realistic QA workflows.

This portfolio is intentionally documentation-focused and reflects how QA work is planned, executed, and iterated in practice.

This QA portfolio is based on testing work carried out on the following projects:

- **shopping-list-app**  
  Full-stack MERN application with automated and manual testing

- **media-playback-time-converter**

- Where possible, artifacts link to real GitHub Issues and commits for traceability.
- All documentation reflects realistic junior QA responsibilities and workflows.
